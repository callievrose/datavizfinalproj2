To get the Word Values Survey data, you must un-compress the zip fileâ€”it was too big to upload to github.

I'm having some trouble deploying my app (I think this is because the dataset is too large) so I'll try to troubleshoot that as soon as possible. For now, I think the best solution is to just download the files from github, unzip the World Values data, and run the Shiny App in R (it's in the app.R file).

Make sure that you install the folowing packages: tidyverse, readr, countrycode, ggpubr, ggeasy, sp, sf, sfheaders, scales, shiny, shinydashboard
